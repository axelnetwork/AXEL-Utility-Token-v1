<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WALLET SERVICES</h3>
<p><b>2.1.	AXEL Wallet and Wallet Services.</b> As part of your AXEL Account, AXEL will provide qualifying users access to: (a) a hosted AXEL Wallet for holding AXEL Tokens.

<p><b>2.2.	AXEL Internal and External Wallets.</b> AXEL provides both an Internal wallet (<b>AXEL Internal Wallet</b>) and an External Wallet (<b>AXEL External Wallet</b>), collectively known as "AXEL Wallets."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.1	AXEL Internal Wallets can be used to manage Airdrop tokens for the purpose of utilizing products and services on the AXEL.Network CDN (Content Distribution Network) and associated services including IPFS (<b>Interplanetary File System</b>) and the AXEL.Exchange (<b>AXEL Exchange</b>).
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.2	AXEL Tokens held in AXEL Internal Wallets may not be transferred out of, or transferred to an AXEL External Wallet (AXEL Wallet) at any time. AXEL Tokens held within the AXEL Internal Wallet are designated solely for use on AXEL.Network CDN services as described above in 2.1.1.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.3	AXEL External Wallets are used to house AXEL Tokens which may be freely transferred to other AXEL Wallets, or to 3rd parties, entities, or other persons with which you choose to transfer AXEL Tokens.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.4	AXEL External Wallets may transfer AXEL Tokens to AXEL Internal Wallets for use on the AXEL.Network CDN and associated services as outlined above in 2.1.1. Transfer of AXEL Tokens from the AXEL External Wallet to the AXEL Internal Wallet are one-way only and may not be reversed or cancelled.
 
<p><b>2.3.	Supported Digital Currencies.</b> Your AXEL Wallet is intended solely for proper use hosting AXEL Tokens only. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your AXEL Wallet to store, send, request, or receive any digital currencies or tokens other than the AXEL Token. AXEL assumes no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use your AXEL Wallet with any token or digital currency except AXEL Tokens.

<p><b>2.4.	Ownership.</b> As the owner of AXEL Tokens in your AXEL Wallet(s), you shall bear all risk of loss of such. AXEL shall have no liability for fluctuations in the price or value of AXEL Tokens.

<p><b>2.5.	Security.</b> AXEL shall retain control over electronic private keys associated with AXEL Wallets.

<p><b>2.6.	Control.</b> You control the AXEL Tokens held in your AXEL External Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your AXEL Tokens (from your AXEL External Wallet) by sending them to a different blockchain address.

<p><b>2.7.	Acknowledgement of Risk.</b> You acknowledge that AXEL Tokens are not subject to protections or insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

<p><b>2.8.	Transaction Fees.</b> Transaction fees may apply to transactions from an AXEL Wallet. Such transaction fees will be disclosed (and, in at least some cases, adjusted or set by users) at the time of the transaction request. By using AXEL Wallet and Wallet Services you agree to pay all applicable fees. AXEL reserves the right to adjust its pricing and fees at any time.

<p><b>2.9.	Unauthorized and Incorrect Transactions.</b> When an AXEL Token transaction occurs using your credentials, we will assume that you authorized such transaction. We are not responsible for any claim for unauthorized or incorrect transactions.
<br><br>

<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXEL TOKEN TRANSFERS</h3>

<p><b>3.1.	In General.</b> Your AXEL External Wallet enables you to send AXEL Tokens to, and request, receive, and store AXEL Tokens from other parties. Your transfer of AXEL Tokens between your other AXEL Wallets (including transfers to AXEL Internal Wallets or wallets off of the AXEL.Network) and to and from third parties is a <b>"Digital Currency Transfer"</b>.

<p><b>3.2.	Pending Transactions.</b> Once a Digital Currency Transfer is submitted to a Digital Currency network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A Digital Currency Transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending Digital Currency Transfers that are initiated from an AXEL Wallet will reflect a pending transaction status and are not available to you for use on the AXEL.Network or otherwise while the transaction is pending.
 
<p><b>3.3.	AXEL Token Transfers.</b> When you or a third party sends AXEL Tokens from a wallet, the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network, transaction, or masternode fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient fees may cause an AXEL Token Transfer to remain in a pending state outside of AXEL's control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. <b>By initiating an AXEL Token Transfer, you attest that you are transacting solely in AXEL Tokens, and your Transfer is directed to other AXEL Wallets. Erroneously transmitted AXEL Tokens will be lost.</b> We recommend Users send a small amount of AXEL Tokens as a test prior to initiating a send of a significant amount of AXEL Tokens.

<h3>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK DISCLOSURES</h3>

You understand that AXEL Tokens have many risk factors. You should carefully consider whether acquiring and holding AXEL Tokens is right for you. The following provides a high-level summary of some of the key risk factors:
<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;AXEL is a "start-up" company. Financial and operating risks confronting startups are significant: AXEL is not immune to these. The startup market in which AXEL competes is highly competitive and the percentage of companies that survive and prosper is small. Startups often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved. In addition, startups may require substantial amounts of financing, which may not be available through institutional private placements, the public markets or otherwise.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;AXEL may be forced to cease operations. It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, the inability by AXEL to establish the utility of AXEL Tokens, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, AXEL may no longer be viable to operate, and AXEL may dissolve.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The services associated with AXEL Tokens may not be widely adopted and may have limited users. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of AXEL services and therefore the potential utility and value of Tokens.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;AXEL may not be able to build strong brand loyalty in the social media landscape. AXEL believes that brand name recognition is of great importance to the sustainability of AXEL. There is no assurance that AXEL will be able to gain acceptance in the social media, social media marketing, social media software industry. A failure by AXEL to develop its brand name would have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and value of the AXEL Tokens.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;AXEL Tokens are not legal tender, are not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of AXEL Tokens.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions in AXEL Tokens may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;Some AXEL Token transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the User initiates the transaction.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of AXEL Tokens may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for AXEL Tokens, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of the AXEL Token should the market disappear.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no assurance that a person who accepts AXEL Tokens as payment today will continue to do so in the future.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The volatility and unpredictability of the price of AXEL Tokens relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of AXEL Tokens (and all crypto-type tokens in general) may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack.<br><br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of AXEL Tokens (or any digital token or currency) means that any technological difficulties experienced by AXEL may prevent the access or use of a User's AXEL Tokens.
